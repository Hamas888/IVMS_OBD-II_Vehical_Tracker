## Overview
The IVMS OBD-II is a powerful, plug-and-play GPS vehicle tracker, designed for comprehensive real-time vehicle monitoring, tracking, and management. It connects directly to the OBD-II port, enabling access to various vehicle parameters, driver behavior insights, and remote management capabilities. This tracker is ideal for personal vehicle security and fleet management applications, offering seamless integration with a mobile app and cloud portal.

### Key Highlights
- **Smart Access Control**: Requires pairing with the owner’s mobile app and proximity detection to enable vehicle functionality.
- **Real-Time Vehicle Insights**: Tracks location, car status, and driving behavior, reporting data through a secure cloud portal.
- **Remote Fleet Management**: Fleet managers can monitor vehicle location, driving patterns, and other parameters via the portal over LTE.
- **Automatic Firmware Updates**: The device receives OTA firmware updates via 4G LTE, ensuring the latest features and security patches.

## Features

- **Multi-Level Security**: The device uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) proximity detection to lock/unlock vehicle functions, ensuring only authorized users can start the vehicle. An alternative BLE-based security tag can be used as an emergency access method.
- **App Integration**: Available for Android and iOS, the companion app provides real-time vehicle status, location tracking, and driving alerts.
- **Remote Immobilization**: Fleet managers can disable the vehicle remotely via the cloud portal, performing reset or special functions for enhanced security.
- **Customizable Alerts**: This feature sends alerts on driving behaviors, such as harsh acceleration or braking, along with real-time notifications to the driver and fleet manager.

## Technical Specifications

- **ESP32-S3 Microcontroller**: The main controller for processing and communication.
- **SIM7600-H Module**: Provides high-speed 4G LTE connectivity for remote data logging, location tracking, and OTA updates.
- **STN OBD-II Interface**: Reads comprehensive vehicle diagnostics and parameters directly from the OBD-II port.
- **BLE Proximity Detection**: The device calculates the distance from the paired mobile app to secure vehicle access.
- **ESP-NOW Communication**: Wireless protocol used for secure, low-latency communication with in-vehicle relays and sensors, such as a tamper sensor for license plate detection.

## Key Functions

1. **Vehicle Tracking and Status Monitoring**
   - Provides real-time GPS location updates.
   - Monitors car parameters like speed, RPM, fuel level, and battery voltage.
   - Tracks driver behavior, such as harsh acceleration, braking, and cornering.
   - Uploads data to the cloud portal for fleet management and review.

2. **Smart Security Features**
   - BLE-based proximity control restricts vehicle use when the owner's phone or security tag is not nearby.
   - Detects unauthorized actions, such as license plate tampering, via ESP-NOW communication with in-vehicle sensors.
   - Remote immobilization allows fleet managers to disable the vehicle via the portal, adding an extra layer of security.

3. **Cloud Integration and OTA Updates**
   - The device supports automatic over-the-air firmware updates through the cloud portal over 4G LTE.
   - Portal administrators can force firmware updates for specific devices or groups based on IMEI numbers.
   - Offers remote reset and configuration management to keep all devices up-to-date.

## Vehicle Parameters Monitored
The DB3 tracker provides detailed information on a range of vehicle parameters:

- **Basic Vehicle Data**: Odometer, Speed, RPM, Fuel Level
- **Engine Performance**: Engine Load, Throttle Position, Timing Advance
- **Sensor & Diagnostic Data**: Coolant and Intake Air Temperatures, MAF (Mass Air Flow) Sensor Data, Intake Manifold Pressure, Fuel Pressure, Oxygen Sensor Data
- **Battery and System Health**: Battery Voltage, System Errors, DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Codes)

## Hardware Design
The hardware is designed for durability and reliability, using high-quality components suitable for automotive and industrial environments. The device’s compact design fits seamlessly into standard OBD-II ports, supporting robust thermal management and EMC protections.

### Key Components
- **ESP32-S3**: Handles processing, BLE, and ESP-NOW communication.
- **SIM7600-H**: Manages 4G LTE connectivity for remote data logging and OTA updates.
- **STN OBD-II Chip**: Reads vehicle diagnostics and relays data to the main controller.
- **Wireless Relays & Sensors**: Communicate with the ESP32-S3 via ESP-NOW, allowing the device to detect and respond to tampering or security breaches.

## Firmware
The firmware is optimized to provide the following key functionalities:

- **Data Collection and Logging**: Collects vehicle data from OBD-II, logs events, and uploads them to the cloud.
- **Driving Behavior Analysis**: Monitors and reports on driving patterns, generating alerts for fleet managers and drivers.
- **Security Management**: Enforces BLE proximity-based access control and triggers alerts for unauthorized access or tampering.
- **OTA Firmware Updates**: Enables automatic firmware updates over LTE for device improvements and security patches.

## Future Enhancements
- **Enhanced Data Analytics**: Introducing advanced cloud-based monitoring and analytics for deeper insights into vehicle performance and driver behavior.
- **Enhanced Security Features**: Adding biometric or multi-factor authentication to further secure vehicle access.
- **Support for CAN Bus Integration**: Extending support to include CAN bus data, providing a broader set of diagnostic information from the vehicle.
- **Geofencing Capabilities**: Enabling configurable geofencing to alert fleet managers if vehicles leave or enter specified zones.
